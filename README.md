# To-Do Application

## Overview

This is a creative and interactive To-Do application developed using [Angular](https://angular.io/) (or [React](https://reactjs.org/)) and integrated with the [JSONForms](https://jsonforms.io/) library. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, including adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. Each task has details such as a title, description, due date, and priority. Additionally, custom renderers are implemented for the priority selection and date picking fields to enhance the user experience.
